# puztool - Tools for puzzles

I solve a lot of puzzles, and over time I've accumulated various code snippets
that I find myself using frequently. This repo serves both as a place for me to
store and organize them, and also as a place from which other interested people
can get them to play around with.

TODO: write a proper readme.
